                <p>ALANA Chat is a space for discovery and communication. There are many opportunities for students of color to receive professional, academic, and financial support at RIT, but there is not any central place to find all these resources. ALANA Chat gathers all these resources in one place and provides a searchable filter system so you can narrow your search to your specific needs. This hub allows students of color to communicate with one another, building community enriched and informed resources for them to succeed.</p>
